## Method

Makes 1 gigantic deep-fried taco

NOTE: It’s recommended to remove the corn husk (as corn husks are inedible), and omit the blueberry pancake all together.  Additionally, if you want more compatible flavors, substitute chorizo for the merguez, additional monterey jack for the gruyere, and skip the pico de gallo/baking step.  Frying this taco is dangerous - make sure to use extra long/wide tongs, protective gloves, and extreme caution when lowering it into the hot oil.  Better yet, just don’t make this thing at all please.

To make crepe batter, combine eggs, milk, flour, vegetable oil, and salt in the jar of a blender.  Blend on high speed for 1-2 minutes, until completely smooth.  Pour onto a preheated crepe griddle, and use a wooden dowel to spread into a thin layer.  Cook according to manufacturer’s directions, and stack crepes on a plate covered with aluminum foil to keep warm.

To make pancake batter, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, and baking soda in a large bowl.  Add egg and cooled melted butter, and whisk until batter forms, allowing batter to remain slightly lumpy.  Pour about 3/4 cup onto a 13” crepe griddle and spread as necessary until batter reaches the edges of the griddle.  Top with blueberries and allow to cook until bubbles begin forming all over the pancake and edges turn glossy, and bottom has browned.  Flip, and continue to cook until fluffy and thick.  Place on a plate and cover with aluminum foil to make the pancake as flexible as possible.

To make the pico de gallo, combine tomatoes, onion, salt, lime juice, and cilantro.

To make the beer batter, combine flour, corn starch, beer, salt, and eggs.  Whisk until smooth.

To make the Southwestern sauce, whisk together sour cream, mayo, paprika, cayenne, and chili powder.

To make the guacamolito sauce, combine guacamole and sour cream.

Brown the ground beef and add the taco seasoning, along with 2-3 tablespoons of water, as per package instructions.

Heat very large pot of oil (at least 15” in diameter) to 350F.  Begin assembling the taco: start by filling a crunchy taco shell with ground beef, and topping with lettuce, tomatoes, southwestern sauce, and nacho cheese.  Spread refried beans on a flour tortilla, and wrap around taco shell.  Place monterey jack cheese on a toasted corn tortilla, and wrap that around the flour tortilla.  Fill a chalupa shell with guacamolito sauce and place the multi-layered taco inside.  Place the chalupa taco into a corn husk, and top with pico de gallo - bake in a 350F oven for 5 minutes.  Meanwhile, cover a single crepe with scrambled eggs, merguez sausage, and gruyere cheese.  Take the taco out of the oven, remove the corn husk, and wrap inside the crepe.  Place the crepe-taco onto the meat lovers pizza, wrap it around the taco, and finish by wrapping the blueberry pancake around the pizza.  Press together as tightly as possible without breaking any of the layers. Secure with long wooden skewers, and using a wide casserole filled with some beer batter, cover the entire taco in batter.  Using extreme caution, place the battered taco in the hot oil, basting with a metal ladle if not completely covered by the oil.  Fry for 10 minutes on each side, until golden brown and crispy all over.  Remove from the oil and allow to cool for 5-10 minutes on a wire rack in a rimmed baking sheet.  Fill a canvas bag with vegetarian chili, and place the taco inside.  Enjoy?
